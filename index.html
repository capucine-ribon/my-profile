			<h1> Welcome to Capucine Ribon's life :)</h1>

			<p>
			Hi everyone ! I'm Capucine an 18-year-old girl, currently in first year at ESSEC Business School in Cergy and who grew up next to Lyon. I love speed, adrenaline, breathing in the pure oxygen on top of the mountain, listen to and play music, my country, take photos of this amazing life, see happy people, do some sports, to be proud of myself and read books that makes me think.

			<h2>Adrenaline ðŸ•Š</h2>
				<p>I am passionate about adrenaline, I constantly seek it in my life. I need it to feel free. I love the speed I find in skiing, motorcycling, wakeboarding. I love the strong emotions I can find in roller coasters, bungee jumps and parachutes. I want to discover the world through trips, unforeseen adventures or walks or by car.</p>

			<h2>Arts ðŸŽ¨</h2>
				<p>I love art in general and I think I live with it every day. Whether itâ€™s through sport (in the gym, running, pilates), books (novels, history, culture), music (to fall asleep, to party, to think), painting (to laugh, to relax, to let off steam), writing (for my future self, to externalize, to remember) or even videos (documentaries, films, funny videos).</p>
		</div>
		<div class="card-white">
			<h2>France ðŸ¥–</h2>
				<p>Although I had the incredible chance to travel around the world, France remains the most beautiful country in the world. It includes all the most incredible landscapes (cities, historical monuments, fields in spring, sea and ocean in summer, etc.) and it is in this one that I feel at home. It is through this that I rediscover my culture, my values, our history and our struggles.</p>
